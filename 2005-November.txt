Subject: [Foopanel-users] [announce] Foopanel 0.0.1 hits the streets!
Message-ID: <438363A6.9080208@gmail.com>

Foopanel first release, 0.0.1, was just made public.
It is not yet complete, but already quite usable and, I hope, useful.

---
Foopanel is a powerful desktop panel that enables you to have all
that you want just one-click-far.
It is extensible through Plugins and fully themeable.
---

Have a look at the home page (http://foopanel.berlios.de/) or go straight
downloading it: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5218

Please test it and report any problems you had.
Comments and suggestions are really welcome, too.

Bye,
Federico "Fredp" Pelloni

Message-ID: <438A1A7F.4000907@gmail.com>

Foopanel 0.0.2 has been released.
This new release features two more plugin bundled: "Windowlist" and 
"Pager" (in addiction to "Menu" and "Clock"), plus some fixes to make 
Foopanel work with PyGTK < 2.8.
If you want to use one of the new plugins, then there is an extra 
dependency: "gnome-python-extras", as they are simple wrappers to the 
libwnck functions.
Moreover, there is a new version of the "Menu" plugin that prevents the 
menus from exiting from the edges of the screen: when necessary, a 
scrollbar appears.
