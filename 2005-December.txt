Hello,

 

This offer might be strange, but is the wish of a dying 70 years old woman
who now realizes  belatedly that there is more to life than mere acquisition
of cash{money} and fame. My name is Mrs. Maria Hoopla a widow. My late
husband and I perhaps due to our aristocratic background and bad influences
lived and never cared for nobody or whose ox was gored, our motto was be
rich and famous and the world will be at your feet. I am diabetic and
recently diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The report is obviously not
good, several chemotherapy treatments have not helped either and the obvious
fact is that I have few days/weeks more on planet earth.

 

Being childless couple, I inherited all my husband wealth and our relations
are no good, as they are waiting patiently for my death to use all our money
for illicit and obscene business/things. Before my health deteriorated that
I am completely dependant on them for basic necessities I have done
charitable ventures within our neighborhoods and beyond and this angered
them as they wish to reap from where they did not sow.

 

Having come to the realizations of what life is all about-caring for
others. I have given legal consent and full authority to my
attorney-Barrister Ruud Van Boer of Winschoten Consultants based in
Amsterdam the Netherlands to immediately disburse all the money to
people/charitable homes and the choice of beneficiaries was done by
sampling. Your name was luckily picked and I have willed the sum of
U.S.D{Ten Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S.D} only to you wish is
presently deposited in a security company.

 

This money should be used STRICTLY for humanitarian/charitable cause.
Contact my lawyer immediately who will guide you on the modalities on how
you are to visit the security company in Amsterdam the Netherlands for the
collection of this money. His e-mail address is  ruudvanboer at netscape.net.
Please quote my personal reference number for ease of
collection-law/chamber/solicitors/je/ws/WILL/000122 when reaching him by
mail, he will give you all the Legal documents to boost the release of the
Funds to you.

 

I plead with you never to deviate from this agreement and I beg of you to
pray that my soul rest in peace.

 

Thanks.
 

Mrs. Maria Hoopla

GOOD DAY TO YOU,

MY NAME IS MR.GEORGE A. MCDONALDS, WORKING WITH THE MINING FINANCE DEPT.
WITH STANDARD BANK LONDON.

WE HAD A FOREIGN CUSTOMER WHO DEPOSITED A HUGE SUM OF MONEY WITH OUR BANK,
WHO LATER DIED AS A RESULT OF PLANE CRASH IN 1999. BEFORE HIS DEATH,

HE TRANSFERED THE SUM OF US$26.5M (TWENTY-SIX MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED SATES DOLLARS) TO A BANK IN AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND.


SINCE THE DEATH OF THIS CUSTOMER, I PERSONALLY HAVE WATCHED WITH KEEN
INTEREST TO SEE THE NEXT OF KIN BUT ALL HAS PROVED ABORTIVE AS NO ONE HAS

COME TO CLAIM HIS FUNDS OF US$26.5M (TWENTY-SIX MILLION FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) WHICH HAS BEEN WITH THE BANK IN HOLLAND

FOR A VERY LONG TIME. ON THIS NOTE I DECIDED TO SEEK FOR WHOSE NAME SHALL
BE USED AS THE NEXT OF KIN AS NO ONE HAS COME UP TO BE THE NEXT OF KIN.

IN VIEW OF THIS I GOT YOUR CONTACT THROUGH MY COUNTRY`S FOREIGN TRADE
MISSION AFTER I WAS CONVINCED BY PROVIDENCE THAT YOU COULD BE USED AS THE

NEXT OF KIN 

THE REQUEST OF THE FOREIGNER AS A NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS
OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND YOU SHARE THE

SAME SURNAME AND SOMEBODY IN LONDON CANNOT STAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO OUR
LATE CUSTOMER

I AGREED THAT US$5 MILLION OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS A FOREIGN
PARTNER FOR PROVIDING AN ACCOUNT, WHILE THE REST WILL BE FOR ME,

THEREAFTER, I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR DISBURSEMENT AS I AM ALMOST DUE
FOR RETIREMENT.

THEREFORE, TO FACILITATE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOUR
ACCOUNT AS ARRANGED, YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS A RELATION TO


THE DECEASED INDICATING YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE NUMBER, AND FAX NUMBER FOR
EASY COMMUNICATION AND LOCATION WHERE THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.

UPON THE RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY, I WILL SEND YOU BY FAX OR E-MAIL THE NEXT
STEP TO TAKE.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS BUSINESS IS HITCH-FREE
AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEAR AS THE WHOLE REQUIRED

ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSFER.

YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY YOU RECEIVE THIS EMAIL OR CALL ME ON

MY NUMBER +44 704 012 8295.

TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU.

YOUR RESPECTFULLY,

GEORGE A. MCDONALDS.

Hi!

I think in mediacontrol plugin quodlibet should be stated no by
os.system("quodlibet &") but by os.spawnlp(os.P_NOWAIT, 'quodlibet',
'&').

Hi!

I'm sorry I reply only today but I lost this post in the sea of spam
that is striking this list :-(

However I'll try your suggestion and probably put it into SVN (that
currently is not working, as
I am making great changes to config and plugins sections).

Thank you very much,
Federico "Fredp" Pelloni

Hi!

I can't input anything in quickterminal plugin.
As I understand this is because quickterminal window type is
gtk.WINDOW_POPUP. Changing it to gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL solve this problem.

Best regards.

Let me say it: YOU'RE GREAT!

Thank you very much.
Now it is fixed in SVN, and the behaviour has been changed a little:
now typing "exit" in the shell pops down the window.

Bye
