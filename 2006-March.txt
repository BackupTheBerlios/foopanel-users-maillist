Hi everybody, just some words to let you know Foopanel 0.1.0 was released :-D
And now, it can even look like a regular application.

Please check out and try it, feedback is very appreciated.

------

WHAT IS IT?
Foopanel is a powerful desktop panel that enables you to have all that you want
just one-click-far. It is extensible through Plugins and fully themeable. 
See more at http://foopanel.berlios.de/

WHAT'S NEW?
The One Big Step! Now Foopanel can be installed to the system (no more need to
run from the source directory) and it features a quite complete graphical
configuration interface.

Various plugins (Clock, CPULoad, Flexible space, MemInfo, Menu, MusicControl, Pager,
QuickTerminal, Separator, VolumeControl) and one theme (SolidBlue) are bundled.

Requirements for this release are: Python 2.3+, GTK+ 2.6+, PyGTK 2.6+ and, 
optional, PyXDG 0.14+ and Gnome-python-extras

 Dear Her Federico,

I would like to thank you for your foopanel work.

If I may ask help for some peculiar difficulties,
   I experience problem when I include the plugin "menu".

Here follows is the info display in the terminal window when I run foopanel.

If I disable the "menu" plugin, all run smoothly.

Hope in a reply to help me solve the problem.

Thank you in advance,

best regards and good work,

Ernesto

Hi

That is a known bug, that should have been fixed in SVN and probably
will be included in the next release (with some other fixes).
Try checking out the SVN code and see if it works.
Then let me know if it worked

Bye
