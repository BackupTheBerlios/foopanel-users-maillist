<PRE>Hello,

 

This offer might be strange, but is the wish of a dying 70 years old woman
who now realizes  belatedly that there is more to life than mere acquisition
of cash{money} and fame. My name is Mrs. Maria Hoopla a widow. My late
husband and I perhaps due to our aristocratic background and bad influences
lived and never cared for nobody or whose ox was gored, our motto was be
rich and famous and the world will be at your feet. I am diabetic and
recently diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The report is obviously not
good, several chemotherapy treatments have not helped either and the obvious
fact is that I have few days/weeks more on planet earth.

 

Being childless couple, I inherited all my husband wealth and our relations
are no good, as they are waiting patiently for my death to use all our money
for illicit and obscene business/things. Before my health deteriorated that
I am completely dependant on them for basic necessities I have done
charitable ventures within our neighborhoods and beyond and this angered
them as they wish to reap from where they did not sow.

 

Having come to the realizations of what life is all about-caring for
others. I have given legal consent and full authority to my
attorney-Barrister Ruud Van Boer of Winschoten Consultants based in
Amsterdam the Netherlands to immediately disburse all the money to
people/charitable homes and the choice of beneficiaries was done by
sampling. Your name was luckily picked and I have willed the sum of
U.S.D{Ten Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S.D} only to you wish is
presently deposited in a security company.

 

This money should be used STRICTLY for humanitarian/charitable cause.
Contact my lawyer immediately who will guide you on the modalities on how
you are to visit the security company in Amsterdam the Netherlands for the
collection of this money. His e-mail address is  <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/foopanel-users">ruudvanboer at netscape.net.</A>
Please quote my personal reference number for ease of
collection-law/chamber/solicitors/je/ws/WILL/000122 when reaching him by
mail, he will give you all the Legal documents to boost the release of the
Funds to you.

 

I plead with you never to deviate from this agreement and I beg of you to
pray that my soul rest in peace.

 

Thanks.
 

Mrs. Maria Hoopla
