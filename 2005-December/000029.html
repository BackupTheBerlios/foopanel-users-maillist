<PRE>
GOOD DAY TO YOU,

MY NAME IS MR.GEORGE A. MCDONALDS, WORKING WITH THE MINING FINANCE DEPT.
WITH STANDARD BANK LONDON.

WE HAD A FOREIGN CUSTOMER WHO DEPOSITED A HUGE SUM OF MONEY WITH OUR BANK,
WHO LATER DIED AS A RESULT OF PLANE CRASH IN 1999. BEFORE HIS DEATH,

HE TRANSFERED THE SUM OF US$26.5M (TWENTY-SIX MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED SATES DOLLARS) TO A BANK IN AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND.


SINCE THE DEATH OF THIS CUSTOMER, I PERSONALLY HAVE WATCHED WITH KEEN
INTEREST TO SEE THE NEXT OF KIN BUT ALL HAS PROVED ABORTIVE AS NO ONE HAS

COME TO CLAIM HIS FUNDS OF US$26.5M (TWENTY-SIX MILLION FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) WHICH HAS BEEN WITH THE BANK IN HOLLAND

FOR A VERY LONG TIME. ON THIS NOTE I DECIDED TO SEEK FOR WHOSE NAME SHALL
BE USED AS THE NEXT OF KIN AS NO ONE HAS COME UP TO BE THE NEXT OF KIN.

IN VIEW OF THIS I GOT YOUR CONTACT THROUGH MY COUNTRY`S FOREIGN TRADE
MISSION AFTER I WAS CONVINCED BY PROVIDENCE THAT YOU COULD BE USED AS THE

NEXT OF KIN 

THE REQUEST OF THE FOREIGNER AS A NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS
OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND YOU SHARE THE

SAME SURNAME AND SOMEBODY IN LONDON CANNOT STAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO OUR
LATE CUSTOMER

I AGREED THAT US$5 MILLION OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS A FOREIGN
PARTNER FOR PROVIDING AN ACCOUNT, WHILE THE REST WILL BE FOR ME,

THEREAFTER, I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR DISBURSEMENT AS I AM ALMOST DUE
FOR RETIREMENT.

THEREFORE, TO FACILITATE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOUR
ACCOUNT AS ARRANGED, YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS A RELATION TO


THE DECEASED INDICATING YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE NUMBER, AND FAX NUMBER FOR
EASY COMMUNICATION AND LOCATION WHERE THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.

UPON THE RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY, I WILL SEND YOU BY FAX OR E-MAIL THE NEXT
STEP TO TAKE.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS BUSINESS IS HITCH-FREE
AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEAR AS THE WHOLE REQUIRED

ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSFER.

YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY YOU RECEIVE THIS EMAIL OR CALL ME ON

MY NUMBER +44 704 012 8295.

TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU.

YOUR RESPECTFULLY,

GEORGE A. MCDONALDS.
+44 704 012 8295
